# Project Maestro

The purpose of this project is to have a platform that instructors and students can use to track assignments & projects

- All student facing pages will be developed using React.
- All instructor facing pages will be developed using PHP.
- The front-end React team will need the back-end team to develop all the necessary REST APIs.

### GitHub Flow
Every time that a developer makes changes, he/she needs to follow the following process:
- create a branch be the issue#
- create a sub-branch if there is more than one person working on the same issue
- make changes and push to issue branch
- before issuing a pull request, make sure you are up-to-date with the main branch by merging the main branch into your own so that all merge conflicts are already resolved, and the changes can be easily tested and approved
- issue a pull request to main and Jakob or Medhat will approve or reject

Remember to make frequent pushes & pulls if you happen to be in a team

### Architecture
- SQLite database will be used
- Back-end will be (among other things) the instructor portal
- Front-end will cater to student interaction

### Azure Sites

- Back-end PHP app https://maestroapp.azurewebsites.net/
